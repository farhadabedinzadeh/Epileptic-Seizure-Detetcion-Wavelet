Wavelet transformations are mathematical instruments for studying data whose characteristics vary across several scales. Features of signals might include time-changing frequencies, transients, or slowly varying trends. Features for photos include edges and textures. Wavelet transformations were developed to circumvent the restrictions of the Fourier transform.
In contrast to Fourier analysis, which decomposes a signal into specific-frequency sine waves, wavelet analysis decomposes signals into shifted and scaled copies of a wavelet. In contrast to a sine wave, a wavelet is a quickly fading wave-like oscillation.

In this project The (Bonn dataset)[] has been used.
